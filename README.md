# Connect Four with Test-Driven-Development

In this project, a connect four console game was created in ruby. The goal of this project was to learn how to develop using the test-driven-development approach. Therefore, tests were written first in RSpec and the corresponding code was written afterwards (test - red - green). 

This project is part of the curricum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code) in the ruby track.
